<p>Returning value to customers transmitting their Continuous Engine Operational Data is crucial to our success, and the work you've been doing to support Flight Phase Analyzer and Fleet Statics Report are key to demonstrating that value. We appreciate your commitment to evolving our CEOD tools, quickly responding to external and internal customer feedback, and ongoing consultation and guidance on next steps. Our CEOD team values your   expertise and we look forward to collaborating with you further this year. Thank you for your enthusiasm and willingness to tackle big challenges.</p>

<p>Carlo thanks for driving and wrangling a half dozen plus of our analytic creation power users and consulting engineers from around the world to slim down the number of parameters we move from EMS into to the Data Lake. Allowing us to stay lean and go fast as we move to support LEAP EIS. This trimmed down list will allow us to have a more stable data lake and be able to move the remaining backlog of flights.

<p>The Predix Insight Explorer tool fills a crucial need in Fleet Support. The tool provides rapid access to all configurations in the Predix ICDL environment, allowing Fleet Support to understand and review the ICDL analytics set-ups in several useful formats. The team created this tool on their own initiative, recognizing the limitations of the current process and anticipating Fleet Support's needs as they constructed this tool over the course of only a few weeks. The Insight Explorer provided an immediate impact to Fleet Support the first day it was released, and it should be used by GE Software Center's Predix team as a model for future analytics configuration user interfaces.</p>

<p>Carlo - I really cannot state how thankful we are to having you as part of the ICDL program. As you know the ICDL GE90/ GEnx/ CFM56-7 Production release was essentially the most significant accomplishment we've had for this program so far...your validation efforts were a CRITICAL component. Considering the show stopper issues we had pre-release, our customer's fear to continue was something I constantly worried about. Your dedication, expertise, and rigor around validation helped us bring focus back to the data - and enabled objective decisions in the face of adversity. Without the efforts of you and your team, we would not be successful. Thank you!</p>

<p>Carlo created much-needed documents to summarize the GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B event and non-event reports. Until the creation of these documents, the end-users of these reports (AOC), as well as those that have to answer customer questions related to there reports (PSE) were unequipped with formal documentation to aid in use of the EMU reports. These reports will set the bar for informing our internal customers of our reports. Thank you, Carlo, for your diligent effort to compile these documents!</p>

<p>Jon and Carlo, lead the effort to develop requirements for the On-board trim balance configuration function. The development of requirements for this function took significant effort over several months, requiring a detailed analysis of Aircraft system behavior. This function will result in customer time savings while on the flight line with regards to Engine vibration systems Maintenance.</p>

<h4>External Focus</h4>
<h4>May 31, 2012</h4>
<p>This award is for the successful design, development and implementation of the GEnx EMU Engine Trim Balance software. During recent flight testing of a production B787 aircraft ZA233, engine 956-117 had higher than normal vibration levels. The flight line personnel were able to successfully use the Engine Trim Balance software with the EMU's generic coefficients to compute a fan balance weight change that lowered the vibration levels on the next flight... This was the first time the EMU Engine Trim Balance software was used on a production aircraft, and it worked per the EMU ICD requirements which allowed the aircraft to continue production testing.</p>
